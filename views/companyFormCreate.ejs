<!-- .the <form> html tag tells the browser that you are creating a form
     .the action attribute in <form> is the web page location for where the information will be sent that the user enters
     .the web url in this example is relative, based on the url in the web browser.  In this example the url in the
       should be http://localhost:3000/users/create/

       .when the form is submitted it will send the form information to http://localhost:3000/users/save/
       .if action attribute was /save/, then the information would go to http://localhost:3000/save/
       .if it was save/, then it would go to http://localhost:3000/create/save/
       .if it was an absolute url, like http://google.com/, it would send the information to http://google.com/
       .if the action attribute was an empty string, or wasn't present, the form is submitted back to the same page.

     .when the <input> tag's type attribute is set to "text" the browser will render an single input text box

     .the <input> tag's id attribute allows you to interact with it using JavaScript.  We will get to that later.

     when it is submitted to the web server.
